 <h1>The Best Movies in my not so Humble Opinion</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 MOATs</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>Just so well thought out, keeps you engaged, grea action, great character development and memorable lines</p>
 <h3>Pineapple Express</h3>
    <p>Stoner comedy at its finest. Quote this movie daily and I randomly remember scenes and start laughing out loud</p>
 <h3>You got Served</h3>
    <p>A Staple of my childhood, sadly I found out I have no rythm but its cool, still fun. Best dance movie of all time.</p>
